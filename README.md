## My process

First, I set up index.html to add all of the contents that I am missing. After doing so, I set up the css files with all of the color pallettes and fonts that are used. I added class names to the html elements to make it easier for me to add styles onto them. After doing so, I troubleshoot with the developer tools in the browser and inspect what was going on each html element.
### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

I learned how to troubleshoot using the debugger tools. I also learned how to solve the problem by asking or searching the right questions in Google. I want to improve on my front end skills so I did my best to what I am capable of then search or ask when I got stuck.

### Continued development

I want to improve on my ability to tell which css properties are being used from a glance. I also want to improve on getting better with manipulating css properties of nonsemantic html elements.

### Useful resources

- [@media rule](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.php) - This helped me learn how to create the design interactive based from the user device.
- [hsl](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl) - This page helped me learn how to use hsl value of color instead of rgb.
